# 🎯 Advanced DataCode Features

This section contains advanced examples of language usage.

## 📋 Contents

### 1. `complex.dc` - Complex Example
**Description**: Demonstrates combining various language features.

**What you'll learn**:
- Combining functions, loops, and conditions
- Recursive functions
- Complex calculations
- Practical usage examples

**Run**:
```bash
cargo run examples/en/04-advanced/complex.dc
```

### 2. `scope_demo.dc` - Variable Scope
**Description**: Demonstrates working with global and local variables.

**What you'll learn**:
- Global variables
- Local variables in functions
- Variables in loops and blocks
- Scope in recursive functions

**Run**:
```bash
cargo run examples/en/04-advanced/scope_demo.dc
```

### 3. `error_handling.dc` - Error Handling
**Description**: Demonstrates error handling with try/catch/throw/finally blocks.

**What you'll learn**:
- Basic try/catch blocks
- try/catch with and without error variables
- try/finally blocks
- try/catch/finally combination
- Using throw to create exceptions
- Nested try/catch blocks
- Error handling in functions
- File operations with error handling
- Error propagation

**Run**:
```bash
cargo run examples/en/04-advanced/error_handling.dc
```

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

### Variable Scope
- **Global variables**: Declared at top level, accessible everywhere
- **Local variables**: Declared inside functions, accessible only within function
- **Function parameters**: Local variables of the function
- **Variables in blocks**: Accessible only within block (if, while, for)

### Error Handling
- **try/catch**: Catch and handle exceptions
- **try/finally**: Always execute cleanup code
- **throw**: Create custom exceptions
- **Nested blocks**: Handle errors at different levels
- **Error propagation**: Errors bubble up through function calls

### Function Composition
Functions can be combined to create more complex solutions:
- Functions can call other functions
- Functions can be arguments to other functions
- Recursive functions can use local variables
